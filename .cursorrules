You are an expert in Rust, TypeScript, async programming, and concurrent systems. Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## Rust General Guidelines

### Key Principles for Rust Code
- Write clear, concise, and idiomatic Rust code with accurate examples.
- Use async programming paradigms effectively, leveraging `tokio` for concurrency.
- Prioritize modularity, clean code organization, and efficient resource management.
- Use expressive variable names that convey intent (e.g., `is_ready`, `has_data`).
- Adhere to Rust's naming conventions: snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and structs.
- Avoid code duplication; use functions and modules to encapsulate reusable logic.
- Write code with safety, concurrency, and performance in mind, embracing Rust's ownership and type system.

### Async Programming in Rust
- Use `tokio` as the async runtime for handling asynchronous tasks and I/O.
- Implement async functions using `async fn` syntax.
- Leverage `tokio::spawn` for task spawning and concurrency.
- Use `tokio::select!` for managing multiple async tasks and cancellations.
- Favor structured concurrency: prefer scoped tasks and clean cancellation paths.
- Implement timeouts, retries, and backoff strategies for robust async operations.

### Channels and Concurrency in Rust
- Use Rust's `tokio::sync::mpsc` for asynchronous, multi-producer, single-consumer channels.
- Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` for broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.
- Implement `tokio::sync::oneshot` for one-time communication between tasks.
- Prefer bounded channels for backpressure; handle capacity limits gracefully.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` and `tokio::sync::RwLock` for shared state across tasks, avoiding deadlocks.

### Error Handling and Safety in Rust
- Embrace Rust's Result and Option types for error handling.
- Use `?` operator to propagate errors in async functions.
- Implement custom error types using `thiserror` or `anyhow` for more descriptive errors.
- Handle errors and edge cases early, returning errors where appropriate.
- Use `.await` responsibly, ensuring safe points for context switching.

### Testing in Rust
- Write unit tests with `tokio::test` for async tests.
- Use `tokio::time::pause` for testing time-dependent code without real delays.
- Implement integration tests to validate async behavior and concurrency.
- Use mocks and fakes for external dependencies in tests.

### Performance Optimization in Rust
- Minimize async overhead; use sync code where async is not needed.
- Avoid blocking operations inside async functions; offload to dedicated blocking threads if necessary.
- Use `tokio::task::yield_now` to yield control in cooperative multitasking scenarios.
- Optimize data structures and algorithms for async use, reducing contention and lock duration.
- Use `tokio::time::sleep` and `tokio::time::interval` for efficient time-based operations.

### Key Conventions in Rust
1. Structure the application into modules: separate concerns like networking, database, and business logic.
2. Use environment variables for configuration management (e.g., `dotenv` crate).
3. Ensure code is well-documented with inline comments and Rustdoc.

### Async Ecosystem in Rust
- Use `tokio` for async runtime and task management.
- Leverage `hyper` or `reqwest` for async HTTP requests.
- Use `serde` for serialization/deserialization.
- Use `sqlx` or `tokio-postgres` for async database interactions.
- Utilize `tonic` for gRPC with async support.

Refer to Rust's async book and `tokio` documentation for in-depth information on async patterns, best practices, and advanced features.
  

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Avoid using any.
- Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
- Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
- Except for well-known abbreviations:
  - i, j for loops
  - err for errors
  - ctx for contexts
  - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
- Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
- Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
- Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
- Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention.


## Commit Message Guidelines
Guidelines for creating conventional commit messages:

### Format

#### General
The format for commit messages using the conventional commits spec: 

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

  - fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
  - feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
  - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
  - footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

### Rules
- Format: `git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"`
- Types: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test
- Scope: lowercase, refers to affected package/app (e.g., api, web, core)
- Description: 
  - Start with lowercase
  - Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
  - No period at end
  - Keep under 60 characters
  - Be specific and concise

Examples:
```
git commit -m "feat(api): add user authentication endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(web): resolve login form validation issue"
git commit -m "docs(core): update API documentation"
```

Note: Breaking changes append "!" after scope:
```
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change authentication API response format"
```
